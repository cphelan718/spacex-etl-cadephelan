An ETL pipeline for SpaceX data

Attached is a .py file with my attempt at an ETL process for SpaceX data. Although familiar with Prefect, I do not have any hands-on experience with it. 

I truly did not use any outside material for this technical assessment, so this was my best attempt.

I have not had much Data Engineering specific experience in the past 1.5 years, but I do find the concepts/methodologies interesting. I would be excited and willing to learn.
